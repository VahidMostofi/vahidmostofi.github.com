    <h1>Hi, It's great to have you in the app</h1>

    <p>This is a work-in-progress application called <strong>"with audio"</strong>.</p>

    <p>This application allows you to listen to content form internet instead of reading it, or listen while following along to improve your reading speed and concentration.</p>

    <p>First of all, thank you for helping me test this application. I'll be in touch to get your valuable feedback, but feel free to contact me anytime.</p>

    <h2>A few notes about the app</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>You are using the test tier, which gives you 10 credits initially. You will receive more credits daily. Each credit can be used to generate audio for one Item.</li>
        <li>You can add web-based items by using the big blue plus button or by sharing links with the "With Audio" app from other applications. We'll process them within minutes, making them available for listening.</li>
        <li>Items you've requested in audio format can be found in the With Audio tab, ready for listening.</li>
        <li>You can bookmark items and view them in the Read Later tab.</li>
        <li>This application also functions as an RSS management tool. If you're not familiar with RSS, think of it as a system to follow content published by your favorite websites. Use the <strong>Feeds</strong> tab to find and follow existing or new RSS feeds. Items from the RSS feeds you follow will appear in your <strong>Home</strong> page. If you selected any category in the personalization process, we've already added some feeds for you. You can remove them in the Feeds tab under my feeds.</li>
    </ul>
